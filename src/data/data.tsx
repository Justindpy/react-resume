  Professionally and as a hobby, I am deeply involved in the world of software development. 
  My main programming language is Java, and I particularly enjoy working with Vaadin to create appealing and 
  functional web applications. Additionally, I have fun enhancing my skills in data visualization using Python. 
  Learning and applying new technologies is an exciting challenge that I am always eager to embrace.`,
